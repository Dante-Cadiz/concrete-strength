# Concrete Strength

## Dataset
- Access on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maajdl/yeh-concret-data)
- 1030 samples of concrete containing their component ingredients along with csMPA, a measurement of their strength in terms of pressure withstood

## Objectives
- Identify the most important component factors that determine the strength of a concrete sample
- Predict the csMPa (measurement unit of concrete strength) of a sample of concrete based on using a regression model trained on train set data
- Determine best feature transformations by testing skewness and kurtosis of variables
- Determine best hyperparameters for machine learning model using GridSearchCV
- Perform cross-validation on chosen model - both 5-fold and K-fold
- Deliver a complete pipeline that contains feature engineering, feature scaling, and the trained model
- Achieve R2 score of 0.9 or higher when predicting on test data
